<h2>Problem</h2>
When traveling it is too cumbersome to find vetted photography spots in the moment for my particular location, time of day, and weather. (without hours of pre-planned location scouting, no option for in the moment wondering plans). Other photographers find locaiton scouting to be a labor intensive task and one that does not leave much room for spontaneity on your trip.

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a simple PowerShell script that walks the user through "zeroing out" (wiping) any drives that are connected to the system. The utility allows you to select the target disk and choose the number of passes that are performed. The PowerShell script will configure a diskpart script file based on the user's selections and then launch Diskpart to perform the disk sanitization.
