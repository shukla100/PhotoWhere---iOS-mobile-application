<h1>PhotoWhere - a native iOS mobile application</h1>
PhotoWhere is a passion project I designed, built and launched on the iOS App Store. This repo outlines how I took an idea — from concept to live app: including the problem, feature prioritization, wireframes & mockups, MVP1 build, customer feedback, and MVP2 roadmap.

<h2>Problem</h2>
Photographers often lack efficient ways to discover vetted, high-quality photography locations in real time — filtered by city and lighting conditions for their exact location. (traditional location scouting is time-consuming and incompatible with dynamic travel plans)

<h2>Solution</h2>
PhotoWhere is a native iOS application that dynamically detects user location (via device GPS or manual input) and applies real-time filtering to surface photography spots. Each result aggregates metadata on lighting conditions (i.e. golden hour/blue hour) and location context, along with a “View on Map” feature that deep-links to exact GPS coordinates in Google Maps for seamless, one-click navigation.
